# 📊 Sentiment Provider Configuration

## 🎯 Provider-Specific Lookback Periods

Our institutional-grade sentiment system now supports **provider-specific lookback periods** to optimize API usage and account for different service limitations:

### 📅 **Lookback Period Configuration**

| Provider | Lookback Period | Reason | Coverage |
|----------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| **Finnhub** | 24 hours (1 day) | Real-time focus, high-frequency updates | Recent market sentiment |
| **Alpha Vantage** | 24 hours (1 day) | Comprehensive recent news analysis | Professional-grade sentiment |
| **NewsAPI** | 720 hours (30 days) | **Free tier limitation compliance** | Historical sentiment context |
| **Synthetic** | 24 hours (1 day) | Fallback consistency | Risk-free backup |

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

```python
SENTIMENT_CONFIG = {
    "providers": {
        "finnhub": {
            "lookback_hours": 24  # 1 day - real-time focus
        },
        "alpha_vantage": {
            "lookback_hours": 24  # 1 day - recent analysis

        }
    }
}
```
